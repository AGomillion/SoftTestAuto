#Software Testing, Automation, and Desgin
Throughout Projects One and Two, I improved my ability to develop software that is both functional and secure. To assure functionality, I use rigorous unit testing and validation methodologies. By building detailed test cases in ContactTest.java and ContactServiceTest.java, I was able to identify logic flaws, validate edge cases, and ensure that each method works as intended. I also utilize input validation and encapsulation to secure sensitive data and prevent misuse, which helps to improve the overall security of the program.
Interpreting user demands begins with a thorough examination of the project requirements and a dedication to comprehending the context in which the product will be utilized. In Project One, for example, I created the contact service to enforce constraints such as maximum field lengths and non-null values, which closely reflected user expectations of data integrity and usability. In Project Two, I used testing methodologies that were linked with real-world use cases to ensure that the software behaved consistently under a variety of scenarios and met the expectations of both users and stakeholders.
When designing software, I use a rigorous and modular approach. I start by breaking down the problem into manageable chunks, then focus on designing clean, maintainable code that follows best practices. In every design decision, I consider clarity, scalability, and testability first. Incorporating testing early in the development cycle allows me to identify issues before they become more serious, and documenting my judgments allows me to communicate the reasoning behind my decisions to coworkers and future reviewers.
Together, these projects have helped me develop into a developer who values precision, usability, and intentional design. They've also emphasized the importance of testing as a critical component of the development process, rather than as a final phase.
